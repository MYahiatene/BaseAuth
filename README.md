# BaseAuth
# Open Source - Basic Authentication Template build in Spring Boot with Nuxt.js

Following project was created inorder to provide a reusable template for possible future projects. 
Since Authentication was proven to be the most important and complex part of a Web-App, we decided to create it first and reuse it in other projects.

The whole project will be and stay Open-Source, since we want to learn and improve our skills through community-feedback.

# To run BaseAuth in a dev env. you need to have
    - NodeJS 16.X
    - OpenJDK 17.X
    - MariaDB:latest (optional) (Planned?!)
# Folder-structure
    - Frontend: ./frontend
    - Backend: ./
# How to start
    1) Use the Terminal and type in "./mvnw spring-boot:run" to start the Sping-Server
    2) Navigate with the Terminal to ./frontend and launch the frontend with "npm run dev"
    Additionaly: If you are using MariaDB, then you need to launch it before the Spring-Server. 
    
# Docker
    We will provide a docker-compose file for testing-purposes. (TODO)
